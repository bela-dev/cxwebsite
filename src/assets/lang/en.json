This includes that as a freelance developer team we don't rely on financial success, but instead focus on exploring new possibilities and personal growth. This allows us to focus entirely on our passion and quality products. All our projects are available for free use and we always aim our software to be used, thought about and developed by other developers. Thus, as part of our security concept, we also publish detailed documentation on projects as well as the entire source code. This is how we want to guarantee our basic values of transparency and data security."

With a simple look and many features, Passx offers the perfect place for your passwords that you can access from anywhere. The special thing about Passx is the encryption concept: Many applications with end-to-end encryption have the disadvantage that you have to transfer the encryption key before you can use the application on a new device. Passx generates this key based on the password chosen by the user, and this password is not stored in any form on our servers. This way we can ensure easy use from anywhere and still maximum security."
